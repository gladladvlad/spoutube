# spoutube
### Download your Spotify playlists off YouTube.

This README.md is a work in progress.

### Setup:

Create a python venv:  
    `python -m venv spoutube-venv`

Activate it:  
    `spoutube-venv/Scripts/activate.bat` on Windows  
    OR  
    `source ./spoutube-venv/bin/activate` on Linux  

In the same terminal instance, install all libs:  
    `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`  

It's important to make sure you run this command immediately after you run 'activate' if you don't want these libraries installed system-wide.
