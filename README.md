This README.md is a work in progress.

Setup:

Create a python venv:
    python -m venv spoutube-venv

Activate it:
    spoutube-venv/Scripts/activate.bat
    OR
    source ./spoutube-venv/bin/activate

First command is for Windows, the 2nd is for Linux machines.

In the same terminal instance, install all libs:
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

It's important to make sure you run this command immediately after you run 'activate' if you don't want these libraries installed system-wide.
